Try solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using genetic algorithm.

## Sudoku Board
![Sudoku](sudoku.png)

## Requirements:
- try solving a 9*9 sudoku game
- some of the cells are given and cant be changed
- the app should show each generations best solution with its fitness function result 
- use the example given
- genetic algorithm can have the following ( Chromosome representation , Fitness Function , Mutation +any thing else mentioned in the lecture) 


# 2. Jigsaw 20*20
Try solving a 20*20 jigsaw puzzle using genetic algorithm.
the image is a 20*20 binary image which is given 

## Binary Image
![Binary Image](binary.png)

## Requirements:
- first create a 20*20 binary image randomly then try solving it
- try solving a 20*20 Jigsaw game
- the target image is gives
- the app should show each generations best solution with its fitness function result 
- genetic algorithm can have the following ( Chromosome representation , Fitness Function , Mutation +any thing else mentioned in the lecture) 


# 3. N-Knight puzzle
Use a genetic algorithm to place as many knights as possible on a chessboard without any knight threatening another. The theoretical maximum for such an arrangement is 32 knights.

try getting as number of knights as much as possible to 32

## Requirements:
- try solving N-Knight puzzle game
- the app should show each generations best solution with its fitness function result 
- genetic algorithm can have the following ( Chromosome representation , Fitness Function , Mutation +any thing else mentioned in the lecture) 

# 4. PSO Visualization
create a app where it shows the PSO particles movement where they reach the goal.

the app is a white board ( or app or any thing )

the particles are placed near each other randomly ( 10 particles ).
the goal and other parameters will be entered by the user.

then the particles start moving toward the goal in a 2fps speed so that the movement be clear 


## Requirements:
- randomly place particles near each other in black color
- the goal position and other parameters are entered by the user
- the goal is in another color
- animation speed ( iteration speed ) should be 2fps
- feel free to use any language/library for UI or Actual code 
- no library should be used for implementing PSO formula, you can use any language you want like ( php, node, c# ..etc )


# 5. KNN sampling method
the app will demonstrate the difference where KNN is used traditional method and the sampling method to reduce the space of the data

the app should give statistical UI with some demonstration on a board where the datas are places and the cluster center points are placed


## Requirements:
- data particle dots are placed on the board
- each data particle has a color according toi the cluster it belongs to
- feel free to use any language/library for UI or Actual code
- no library should be used for implementing KNN formula, you can use any language you want like ( php, node, c# ..etc )

# 6. perceptron learning algorithm (in the lecture)
create a app where it shows the perceptron learning algorithm line movement it justifies itself to satisfy all the points.

the app is a white board ( or app or any thing )

use ten data samples of two classes where each class include 5 samples.
the app will draw the separating line between the two classes

then the line starts adjusting toward the better position in a 2fps speed so that the movement be clear 

the app will save each iteration table in a file

## Requirements:
- if user can enter parameters in the formula if its possible will be better
- animation speed ( iteration speed ) should be 2fps
- open another windows to show the live table or save each table in a file
- feel free to use any language/library for UI or Actual code 
- no library should be used for implementing PSO formula, you can use any language you want like ( php, node, c# ..etc )
